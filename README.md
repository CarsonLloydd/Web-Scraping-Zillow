# Web Scraping Zillow house listings
## Overview
* I built a web scraper, which used Selenium and BeautifulSoup to collect house listings on Zillow.
* This data was used to find out which factors most directly affected house prices in King County, Washington.
* Predicted house prices were developed with a generalized additive model.
* The web scraper and all models were built with Python (BeautifulSoup, Scikit-Learn, Pandas).
